== Summary ==

OhNetSpy is a (quickly thrown together) example OhNet application that scans the network for UPnP devices, lists them, their services and the contents of their services, and provides a view of their device and service XML descriptions.

== Building ==

First of all build ohNet. Copy ohNet.dll and ohNet.net.dll into the lib/ohNet folder. You should now be able to load, build and run OhNetSpy.sln in Visual Studio 2010.

== Install ==

Sorry, there's no installer.
